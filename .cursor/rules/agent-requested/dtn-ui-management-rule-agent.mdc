# Cursor Rules Format

## Context

- Apply this rule when creating or editing any Cursor Rules file.
ll a consisted actionable format for agent comprehension and application.
- Added to standardize rule authoring bility.

## Critical Rules

- All rule files must be located and named as: `.cursor/rules/{organizational-folder}/rule-name-{auto|agent|manual|always}.mdc`
- The front matter section must always start the file and include all 3 fields: description, globs, alwaysApply.
- Rule types:
  - Manual Rule: description and globs MUST be blank, alwaysApply: false, filename ends with -manual.mdc.
  - Auto Rule: description blank, alwaysApply: false, filename ends with -auto.mdc.
  - Always Rule: description and globs blank, alwaysApply: true, filename ends with -always.mdc.
  - Agent Select Rule: description is critical, globs blank, alwaysApply: false, filename ends with -agent.mdc.
- Use concise markdown tailored for agent context window usage.
- Do not repeat content or be overly explanatory in context or bullets.
- When a rule is not always used (alwaysApply: false), the description must clearly state when the agent should load the rule.
- Indent all content within XML Example sections by 2 spaces.
- Emojis and Mermaid diagrams are allowed if they improve agent comprehension.
- Keep total rule line count under 50 lines, ideally under 25.
- Always include a valid and invalid example.
- NEVER use quotes around glob patterns, NEVER group glob extensions with `{}`.
- After creating or updating a rule, respond with:
  - AutoRuleGen Success: path/rule-name.mdc
  - Rule Type: {Rule Type}
  - Short summary of what the rule will do
