# Active Context

This document tracks the current focus and recent updates in the Brick AIAR Unity project.

## Current Work Focus
- Integration of AI-assisted augmented reality features with LEGO components.
- Development of modular prefabs and scenes for LEGO bricks and assemblies.
- Optimization of performance for mobile AR platforms.
- Implementation of user interface elements for intuitive building and interaction.

## Recent Changes
- Added initial LEGO component prefabs with basic interaction scripts.
- Integrated AR Foundation framework for device AR support.
- Set up Addressables for asset management and dynamic loading.
- Began AI module integration for real-time LEGO structure recognition.
- Created IntroScreenController.cs to manage IntroScreen UI and login interactions.
- Integrated FirebaseAuthManager with IntroScreenController for Google and email sign-in.
- Connected Popup_SignIn UI with IntroScreenController for email login flow.

## Next Steps
- Complete AI-assisted feedback system for LEGO building.
- Enhance UI with loading screens and user guidance.
- Optimize rendering and physics for smooth AR experience.
- Conduct testing on target devices for performance and usability.
- Document new UI flows and authentication logic in memory bank.

## Active Decisions
- Use URP for rendering to balance quality and performance.
- Employ ScriptableObjects for configuration data.
- Adopt event-driven communication between systems.
